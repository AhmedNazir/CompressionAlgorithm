# CompressionAlgorithm
Compression algorithms Compression algorithms are normally used to reduce the size of a file without removing information. This can increase their entropy and make the files appear more random because all of the possible bytes become more common. ... The Disguise Compression algorithms generally produce data that looks more random.
